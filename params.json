You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Get Started\r\n\r\nYou can easily get started by modifying `_config.yml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Site settings\r\ntitle: Hux Blog             # title of your website\r\nSEOTitle: Hux Blog\t\t\t# check out docs for more detail\r\ndescription: \"Cool Blog\"    # ...\r\n\r\n# SNS settings      \r\ngithub_username: huxpro     # modify this account to yours\r\nweibo_username: huxpro      # the footer woule be auto-updated.\r\n\r\n# Build settings\r\n# paginate: 10              # nums of posts in one page\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are more options you can check out in the [Jekyll - Official Site](http://jekyllrb.com/), or you can directly dive into code to find more.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Write Posts\r\n\r\nFeel free to checkout Markdown files in the `_posts/`, you will quickly realized how to post your articles with magical markdown plus this nice theme.\r\n\r\nThe **front-matter** of a post looks like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\nlayout:     post\r\ntitle:      \"Hello 2015\"\r\nsubtitle:   \"Hello World, Hello Blog\"\r\ndate:       2015-01-29 12:00:00\r\nauthor:     \"Hux\"\r\nheader-img: \"img/post-bg-2015.jpg\"\r\ntags:\r\n    - Life\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### SideBar\r\n\r\n![](http://huangxuan.me/img/blog-sidebar.jpg)\r\n\r\nSeeing more information may be necessary for you to display, from V1.1, a clean, gorgeous **SideBar** is added for you, which provide more area for displaying possible modules. You can enable *(it is default enable)* this feature by simply config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Sidebar settings\r\nsidebar: true\r\nsidebar-about-description: \"your description here\"\r\nsidebar-avatar: /img/avatar-hux.jpg     # use absolute URL.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe default support *[Featured Tags](#featured-tags)*, *[Mini About Me](#mini-about-me)* and *[Friends](#friends)* these three modules and you can add your own. The sidebar is naturally responsive and would be push to bottom in a small screen size (`<= 992px`, according to [Bootstarp Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid))  \r\nMore details of these three separate modules are talking below.\r\n\r\n#### Mini About Me\r\n\r\nMini-About-Me module display all your SNS buttons also your avatar and the description if you set `sidebar-avatar` and `sidebar-about-description` which is very useful and common for a sidebar so it is default with your sidebar.\r\n\r\nIt is really nice-looking and well-designed. It would be hidden in a small screen seeing the sidebar would be push to bottom and there is already a footer including SNS feature which is similar.\r\n\r\n#### Featured Tags\r\n\r\nConsidering the Featured-Tags feature in [Medium](http://medium.com) is pretty cool, so I add it in my blog theme also.   \r\nThis module is independent of sidebar from V1.4, so it can definitely live without enable sidebar, which would be displayed in the bottom when `sidebar` set to false, and it is not only displayed in home page but also every post page bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Featured Tags\r\nfeatured-tags: true  \r\nfeatured-condition-size: 1     # A tag will be featured if the size of it is more than this condition value\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only one thing need to be paid attention to is the `featured-condition-size`: A tag will be featured if the size of it is more than this condition value.  \r\nInternally, a condition template `{% if tag[1].size > {{site.featured-condition-size}} %}` is used to do the filter.\r\n\r\n#### Friends\r\n\r\nFriends is a very common feature of a blog seeing the SEO, so I add it in V1.1 release to help that.   \r\nFriends can also live without enable sidebar, also be displayed in the bottom when sidebar unable, and be displayed in every post page bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can just add your friends information in `_config.yml` with a familiar JSON syntax and everything is done, very easy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Friends\r\nfriends: [\r\n    {\r\n        title: \"Foo Blog\",\r\n        href: \"http://foo.github.io/\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: \"Bar Blog\",\r\n        href: \"http://bar.github.io\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Keynote Layout\r\n\r\n![](http://huangxuan.me/img/blog-keynote.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere is a increasing tendency to use Open Web technology to create keynotes, presentations, like Reveal.js, Impress.js, Slides, Prezi etc. I consider a modern blog should have abilities to post these HTML based presentation easily also abilities to play it directly.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, a `iframe` is used to include webpage from outer source, so the only things left is to give a url in the **front-matter**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\nlayout:     keynote\r\niframe:     \"http://huangxuan.me/js-module-7day/\"\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe iframe will be automatically resized to adapt different form factors also the device orientation. A padding is left to imply user that there has more content below, also to ensure that there is a area for user to scroll down in mobile device seeing most of the keynote framework prevent the browser default scroll behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Comment\r\n\r\nThis theme support both [Disqus](http://disqus.com) and [Duoshuo](http://duoshuo.com) as the third party discussion system.\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to sign up and get your own account. **Repeat, DO NOT use mine!** (I have set Trusted Domains) It is deathly simple to sign up and you will get the full power of management system. Please give it a try!\r\n\r\nSecond, from V1.5, you can easily complete your comment configuration by just adding your **short name** into `_config.yml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nduoshuo_username: _your_duoshuo_short_name_\r\n# OR\r\ndisqus_username: _your_disqus_short_name_\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To the old version user**, it's better that you pull the new version, otherwise you have to replace code in `post.html`, `keynote.html` and `about.html` by yourselves.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Duoshuo support Sharing. if you only wanna use Duoshuo comment without sharing, you can set `duoshuo_share: false`. You can use Duoshuo Sharing and Disqus Comments together also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Analytics\r\n\r\nFrom V1.5, we support Google Analytics and Baidu Tongji officially with a deathly simple config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Baidu Analytics\r\nba_track_id: 4cc1f2d8f3067386cc5cdb626a202900\r\n\r\n# Google Analytics\r\nga_track_id: 'UA-49627206-1'            # Format: UA-xxxxxx-xx\r\nga_domain: huangxuan.me\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust checkout the code offered by Google/Baidu, and copy paste here, all the rest is already done for you.\r\n\r\n(Google might ask for meta tag \"google-site-verification\")\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Customization\r\n\r\nIf you wanna do more customization and change code yourself, a [Grunt](gruntjs.com) environment is also included. (Thanks to Clean Blog.)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of tasks it performs like minification of the JavaScript, compiling of the LESS files, adding banners to keep the Apache 2.0 license intact, and watching for changes. Run the grunt default task by entering `grunt ` into your command line which will build the files. You can use `grunt watch` if you are working on the JavaScript or the LESS.\r\n\r\n**Try to understand code in `_include/` and `_layouts/`, then you can modify Jekyll [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template directly to do more creative customization.**\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Header Image\r\n\r\nChange header images of any pages or any posts is pretty easy as mentioned above. But, thanks to [issue #6 (in Chinese)](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io/issues/6) asked, **how to make it looks great?**\r\n\r\n**Well...it is actually a design issue**, not a coding stuff. It is better that you have basic design knowledge, but not is ok, let me told you how to make it well-designed:\r\n\r\nSeeing the title text above image is **white**, the image should be **dark** to emphasize the contract. so we can easily add a **black overlay with fews of opacity**, which is depends on the brightness of the original images you used. you can process it in Photoshop, Sketch etc.\r\n\r\nIn technical views, it can be done with CSS. However, the opacity of the black overlay is really hard to assigned, **every image has different brightness so the  degree it should be adjusted is different so it is impossible to hard code it.**\r\n\r\n\r\n#### SEO Title\r\n\r\nBefore V1.4, site setting `title` is not only used for displayed in Home Page and Navbar, but also used to generate the `<title>` in HTML.\r\nIt's possible that you want the two things different. For me, my site-title is **“Hux Blog”** but I want the title shows in search engine is **“黄玄的博客 | Hux Blog”** which is multi-language.\r\n\r\nSo, the SEO Title is introduced to solve this problem, you can set `SEOTitle` different from `title`, and it would be only used to generate HTML `<title>` and setting DuoShuo Sharing.\r\n\r\n#### Page Build Warning\r\n\r\nThere are many possible reasons to cause a \"Page Build Warning\" email or similar error.\r\n\r\nOne of these is that github changes its build environment.\r\n\r\n> You are attempting to use the 'pygments' highlighter, which is currently unsupported on GitHub Pages. Your site will use 'rouge' for highlighting instead. To suppress this warning, change the 'highlighter' value to 'rouge' in your '_config.yml'.\r\n\r\nSo, just edit `_config.yml`, find `highlighter: pygments`, change it to `highlighter: rouge` and the warning will be gone.\r\n\r\nFor other circumstances, check out existing issues or create a new one!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nApache License 2.0.\r\nCopyright (c) 2015-2016 Huxpro\r\n\r\nHux Blog is derived from [Clean Blog Jekyll Theme (MIT License)](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/)\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2016 Blackrock Digital LLC.\r\n",
